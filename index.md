## About Me

I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at TIFR-CAM, Bengaluru, working at the intersection of geophysical fluid dynamics and computational modeling. My research spans wave-vortex interactions, bluff body flows, and energy transport using pseudo-spectral simulations. I hold a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from IIT Indore, where I specialized in heat transfer and computational fluid dynamics.
I’ve qualified GATE multiple times and bring a blend of research, creativity—like winning the TIFR-CAM logo contest—and teaching experience. There’s much more I could share, but this space is for the brief essentials.
