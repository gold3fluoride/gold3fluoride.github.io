## About Me

I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at TIFR-CAM, Bengaluru, working at the intersection of geophysical fluid dynamics and computational modeling. My research focuses on wave–vortex interactions using pseudo-spectral simulations. I hold a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from IIT Indore, where I specialized in heat transfer and bluff body flow control using computational fluid dynamics. 

My academic path spans doctoral and postdoctoral research, teaching, and technical mentoring. I have contributed to peer-reviewed journals, qualified the GATE exam multiple times, and participated in national and international workshops. I am working on high-performance scientific computing, including the parallelization of simulations using Python MPI. 

Creativity has always played a role in my work—from designing logos to building academic websites and contributing to science outreach. This page offers a glimpse; the full story brings together research, teaching, design, and discovery
